The dataset comprises vibrational readings taken from accelerometers.
The accelerometers are the type of sensors used for high and low-frequency vibration measurements. 
The vibrational pattern alters when any fault occurs and the force caused by the vibrations or any change in motion 
squeezes the piezoelectric material which produces an electric charge which is proportional to the force.

Fault Detection through Artificial Intelligence can reduce the machine downtime and have a greater impact on reducing the loss 
due to the fault by predicting it and giving ample time to make future decisions.
